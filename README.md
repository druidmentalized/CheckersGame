# Checkers Game

## Overview
This project is a **Checkers game** featuring a user-friendly **Java Swing** GUI for the graphical interface, with the gameplay logic implemented in **C++**. The integration between Java and C++ is achieved using **Java Native Interface (JNI)**. The game allows two players to enjoy a classic checkers match on the same machine with standard rules.

## Features
- **Interactive GUI**:
  - Choosing tiles or keyboard input functionality for moving pieces.
  - Visual indicators for valid moves.
- **Standard Checkers Rules**:
  - Legal piece movement enforced.
  - Support for mandatory captures.
  - Promotion of pieces to kings.
- **Highlights**:
  - Displays current playerâ€™s turn.
  - Highlights valid moves for the selected piece.
- **Performance**:
  - Core gameplay logic implemented in optimized C++ code for better performance.
- **Error Handling**:
  - Prevents illegal moves and provides on-screen feedback.
- **Unit Testing**:
  - Comprehensive tests using **JUnit** to ensure the correctness of Java components.
